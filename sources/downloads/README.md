# Downloads

Put `killah.dmg` into this folder so the landing CTAs can download it:

- EN: `/sources/downloads/killah.dmg`
- RU: `/sources/downloads/killah.dmg`

Notes:

- GitHub Pages is OK for a small file, but if your `.dmg` is large, prefer hosting it as a GitHub Release asset (or S3/R2/B2) and then update the CTA `href` to that URL.
